What's Actually Happening:

Multer: Only handles file upload - receives the file from browser and stores it temporarily in uploads/ folder

Document AI: Supposed to do intelligent parsing (extract form fields, recognize medical terminology, structure data) - but it's failing with "processor not found"

Basic text extraction: Your fallback fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8') just reads the file as plain text

Document AI is NOT for authentication - it's for intelligent document processing. The authentication is handled by your service account credentials.

What Document AI Should Do:

Extract form fields from PDFs (patient name, insurance info, etc.)

Recognize medical entities and terminology

Structure unstructured documents

Provide confidence scores for extracted data

What's Currently Happening: Since Document AI is failing, your system falls back to basic text reading, which just:

Reads the entire file as one big text string

Uses simple keyword matching to find "requirements"

No intelligent field extraction or medical context understanding

The Flow Should Be:

File Upload → Multer (temporary storage) → Document AI (intelligent parsing) → Requirements extraction → Gemini AI


But Currently Is:

File Upload → Multer (temporary storage) → Document AI (fails) → Basic text reading → Requirements extraction → Gemini AI


So you're missing the intelligent document processing that Document AI should provide. That's why you're not seeing extracted form fields or medical entities - just basic text pattern matching.

can you research how to fix this? check project knwoledge for code files and i have attched gcloud console screenshots on main service acc, apis, document ai and phi buckets. please help.

another thing is if we dont have a protoype link (and i dont mean localhost :)), we wont get selected to phase 3, so please help with this too.
