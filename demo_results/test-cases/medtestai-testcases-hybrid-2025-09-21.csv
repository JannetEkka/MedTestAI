"TC_AUTH_001","Successful Login with Valid Credentials","Authentication","High","Verify that a user can successfully log in to the EHR system with valid username, password, and MFA.","Positive Testing","High","HIPAA Security Rule; SOX ITGC","High","User account exists in the system.; MFA is enabled for the user.","Enter valid username in the username field.; Enter valid password in the password field.; Initiate login.; Enter the MFA code received on the registered device.","User is successfully logged into the EHR system.; User is redirected to the appropriate dashboard based on their role.; Audit log records the successful login event."
"TC_AUTH_002","Failed Login with Invalid Password","Authentication","High","Verify that the system prevents login attempts with an invalid password.","Negative Testing","High","HIPAA Security Rule; SOX ITGC","High","User account exists in the system.; MFA is enabled for the user.","Enter valid username in the username field.; Enter an invalid password in the password field.; Initiate login.","The system displays an error message indicating invalid credentials.; User is not logged into the system.; Audit log records the failed login attempt."
"TC_AUTH_003","Role-Based Access Control - Doctor","Authorization","High","Verify that a user with the 'Doctor' role has access to the appropriate functionalities and data within the EHR system.","Equivalence Partitioning","High","HIPAA Security Rule; SOX ITGC","High","User is logged in as a 'Doctor'.","Navigate to patient records.; Attempt to access administrative functions (e.g., user management).; Attempt to access billing information.","User can access patient records and related medical information.; User is denied access to administrative functions.; User is denied access to billing information."
"TC_AUTH_004","Data Encryption at Rest","Data Security","High","Verify that PHI stored in the database is encrypted using AES-256 encryption.","Black Box Testing","Critical","HIPAA Security Rule; SOX ITGC","Medium","PHI data exists in the database.","Access the database directly (using appropriate credentials, if applicable and permitted for testing).; Query PHI data fields.","PHI data is stored in an encrypted format (unreadable without decryption key).; The encryption algorithm used is AES-256."
"TC_AUTH_005","Data Encryption in Transit","Data Security","High","Verify that PHI transmitted between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS (TLS).","Network Analysis","Critical","HIPAA Security Rule; SOX ITGC","Medium","User is logged in and accessing PHI data.","Use a network analysis tool (e.g., Wireshark) to capture network traffic between the client and server.; Analyze the captured traffic for PHI data.","All traffic containing PHI data is encrypted using HTTPS (TLS).; No PHI data is transmitted in plain text."
"TC_AUDIT_001","Audit Log Completeness","Auditing","High","Verify that all system activities, including login attempts, data access, and modifications, are logged in the audit logs.","Data Integrity Testing","High","HIPAA Accountability; SOX ITGC","Medium","Various system activities have been performed (e.g., login, data modification).","Perform a series of actions within the EHR system (e.g., login, view patient record, modify patient information).; Access the audit logs.; Review the audit logs for corresponding entries for each performed action.","The audit logs contain entries for all performed actions.; Each entry includes relevant information such as timestamp, user ID, action performed, and affected data."
"TC_AUDIT_002","Audit Log Integrity","Auditing","High","Verify that the audit logs cannot be tampered with or modified by unauthorized users.","Security Testing","Critical","HIPAA Accountability; SOX ITGC","Low","Audit logs exist in the system.","Attempt to modify or delete existing audit log entries using various methods (e.g., direct database access, system interfaces).; Attempt to disable audit logging functionality.","Unauthorized users are unable to modify or delete audit log entries.; Unauthorized users are unable to disable audit logging functionality.; The system detects and alerts administrators of any attempted tampering."
